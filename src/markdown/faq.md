questions:
- q: What happens during an Indian wedding?
  a: Indian weddings come in many varieties depending on region & caste and can range from hours to days. Our condensed 1.5 hour ceremony will be following the traditions of the Tamil Brahmins and we have laid out a guide for how our wedding ceremony will run in the Schedule page for those unfamiliar.
- q: What should I wear?
  a: American or Indian clothing are both acceptable. Men wishing to wear Indian clothing can wear a kurta pajama. Women are free to wear a salwar kameez or a saree. Those wishing to remain in more traditional Western (American) clothing are asked to wear formal attire of their choice.
- q: What kind of gift should I bring?
  a: Though we both love gifts, Krishanti and I have more than enough stuff in our small NYC apartment. Those wanting to give a gift are welcome to give cash which will go towards our expenses and honeymoon.
- q: What are we going to be eating?
  a: Rest assured there will be an open bar with plenty of wine (made on location), beer, and liquor. Our hors d'oeuvres and dinner will be a selection of delicious vegetarian Indian-fusion options served buffet-style.
