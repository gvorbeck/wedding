* ### Hi I'm Garrett, and holy shit, you're in a punk band? ###

   It was the day after Krishanti's 28th birthday and Garrett was scrolling through OKCupid. Hungover from a night spent celebrating with friends at Baby Grand, a karaoke bar in lower Manhattan, Krishanti received Garrett’s brilliant ice-breaker and decided to give him a chance. They chatted online about music for a bit before deciding to meet for their first date on August 3rd, 2017 at a quiet bar named Burp Castle.

* ### Yeah, obviously! ###

   On September 28th, 2019 --the last warm weekend of the year-- Garrett asked Krishanti to go on a short walk to the park at the Brooklyn Piers. They found a grassy lone area where he asked Krishanti to marry him. "Yeah, obviously," she said, beaming. Afterward, a surprise engagement party awaited her in a small pizza shop nearby, where they were surrounded by friends and family.
