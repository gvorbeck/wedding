<p class="bubble right">Hi I'm Garrett, and holy shit, you're in a punk band?</p>

It was the day after Krishanti's 28th birthday. Hungover from a night spent singing karaoke with her friends in a small manhattan bar, Krishanti received my very charming OKCupid message and was immediately smitten. Well, probably.

In a small bar in the East Village, Krishanti and I had our first date whispering over dark beers in the quiet hall. We shared shots of fernet with a bartender dressed as a monk. What followed was two years of traveling across the world; lazy weekends in Edison, New Jersey; and embracing our mutual loves of trashy reality TV, punk rock, and cheesecake.

<p class="bubble left">Yeah, obviously.</p>

On September 28th, 2019--the last warm weekend of the year--I asked Krishanti to go on a short walk with me to the park at the Brooklyn Piers. We found a grassy area alone and I asked Krishanti to marry me. "Yeah, obviously," she said, beaming. A surprise engagement party awaited her in a small pizza shop nearby where we were surrounded by our friends and family moments later.
