Hi I'm Garrett, and holy shit, you're in a punk band?

It was the day after Krishanti's 28th birthday and I was scrolling through OKCupid. Hungover from a night spent with friends at Baby Grand, Krishanti received my brilliant ice-breaker and decided to give me a chance. We chatted online about music for a bit before deciding to meet for our first date on August 3rd, 2017 at a quiet bar named Burp Castle.

Yeah, obviously!

On September 28th, 2019--the last warm weekend of the year--I asked Krishanti to go on a short walk with me to the park at the Brooklyn Piers. We found a grassy lone area where I asked Krishanti to marry me. "Yeah, obviously," she said, beaming. Afterward, a surprise engagement party awaited her in a small pizza shop nearby where we were surrounded by our friends and family.
