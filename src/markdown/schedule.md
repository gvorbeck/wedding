* ## Welcome Dinner ##

   This is a ritual that is performed by the bride only. An idol of the [Goddess Gauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahagauri), who represents purity, austerity and virtue, is placed on a plate containing rice and kumkum. After the bride has been dressed up, she offers her prayers and performs a short [puja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)) to the Gauri idol wishing for a happily married life ahead.

* ## Ceremony ##

   The groomâ€™s party arrive at the wedding venue and the groom brings an umbrella, walking sticks and some food items to go off to [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi), renouncing all worldly attachments to pursue religious studies. The father of the bride then intercepts him outside the wedding hall and makes him see the virtues of the domestic life as opposed to a hermitic existence. The father of the bride then promises the groom to give his daughter to him in marriage. The groom accepts this proposal and returns to the wedding venue to get married. The umbrella is to be kept with the groom throughout the wedding to remind him of the decision and his duties thereby.

* ## Reception ##

   After the groom arrives at the wedding [mandapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandapa), the parents of the bride washes his feet with holy water, sandalwood, milk, and [kumkuma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumkuma). His feet are then wiped dry with flower petals.

* ## Farewell Brunch ##

   The bride is then brought into the wedding mandapam and the couple exchange flower garlands as a first step of the wedding. The ritual is repeated three times and sometimes amid much playfulness where the bride/groom tries to evade garlanding by the other.
